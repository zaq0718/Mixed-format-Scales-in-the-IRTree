**Purpose**: This project examines positive and negative worded items in a multiple -response processes model. 
A new proposed bi-factor model (Wang, Chen, & Jin, 2015) will be incorporated a multiple-response processes model (Böckenholt, 2012). 

**Data**: The constructs of neuroticism and extraversion will be analyzed. 
The data were from [PIAAC Pilot Studies on Non-Cognitive Skills](https://www.gesis.org/en/piaac/rdc/data/piaac-pilot-studies-on-non-cognitive-skills/) 

**Code**: 
Winbugs_Code: Winbugs is used to run the IRTree model in which takes negative items into account.
